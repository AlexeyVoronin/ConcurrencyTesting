Tutorial Setup:

1. The tutorials use NUnit or MSTest.  When you open the project in Visual Studio,
ensure that the project builds.  You may have to fix some of your references.  If
you prefer to use NUnit, look at the introduction in Lesson 0, Exercise 1.

2. Try running the tests in Lesson 0, Exercise 1 right away.  Windows may have
blocked the "dll" files from the zip file when it was downloaded.  You will know
if this is the case if Visual Studio says that the dlls are untrusted.  To fix 
this problem, from Windows Explorer, right-click on the dll and select properties.
On the main tab, at the bottom, click on the "unblock" button for all dll files.
